          "The global energy landscape is undergoing a massive transformation, yet household consumers remain largely disconnected from the opportunities created by this shift. While millions of homes are now equipped with solar panels, smart meters, and battery storage systems, the infrastructure to support decentralized energy exchange is still fragmented, outdated, and inefficient. Most households with surplus energy have no direct means to trade it or monetize it—leading to wasted potential and missed financial incentives. Traditional utility models are centralized and rigid, offering little transparency or control to end users. Energy pricing is often unpredictable, billing lacks clarity, and consumers are typically locked into inflexible contracts. This disconnect not only limits household agency but also places enormous strain on central grids—especially during peak hours or climate-driven disruptions. Moreover, while energy data is being generated at an unprecedented scale, it remains largely underutilized. Without intelligent systems to analyze and act on this data, users cannot make informed decisions about when to consume, store, or sell energy. As a result, households miss out on both economic and environmental benefits. ",

This leads to expensive repairs, turbine downtime, and lost energy production. Compounding the issue, turbines are equipped with hundreds of components and sensors generating vast volumes of data. Yet, much of this data goes underutilized due to a lack of intelligent tools that can interpret patterns, predict failures, and recommend timely actions.

          "With the global surge in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, the health and longevity of EV batteries have emerged as pivotal factors impacting overall vehicle performance, operational safety, resale value, and the total cost of ownership. Despite the critical role batteries play in e-mobility, many stakeholders—including fleet operators, OEMs, and mobility providers—face significant challenges in understanding and managing real-time battery health across their operations. Most existing battery monitoring systems are either proprietary, hardware-dependent, or offer only fragmented insights. These systems often fail to provide continuous, scalable, and actionable intelligence across diverse fleets and multi-vendor battery configurations. As a result, businesses lack a unified view of battery status, struggle with inconsistent diagnostics, and remain reactive rather than proactive in maintenance and decision-making. This lack of transparency and real-time data leads to a range of operational issues: unexpected battery failures, inefficient maintenance cycles, reduced battery life, and unanticipated downtimes that disrupt fleet reliability and increase costs. Furthermore, without reliable lifecycle data or predictive analytics, stakeholders cannot accurately forecast battery degradation, schedule timely replacements, or meet evolving regulatory and sustainability requirements."

          "We specialize in architecting and delivering intelligent, future-ready data platforms that transform how public sector organizations operate in the digital age. With a deep understanding of the unique needs of government institutions, our mission is to help them modernize legacy infrastructures, break data silos, and harness the full potential of their data assets. For the Flemish Employment and Vocational Training Service (VDAB), we partnered to build a cutting-edge, cloud-native data platform tailored to the demands of a dynamic labor market. This comprehensive platform supports end-to-end data integration, real-time processing, advanced analytics, and predictive modeling—all within a secure and compliant environment. Our solution empowers VDAB to go beyond traditional reporting and embrace data-driven strategies for workforce development. By unifying scattered data sources across employment services, training programs, job seekers, and labor market indicators, we enabled a 360-degree view of citizens' needs and program performance. With scalable infrastructure, automated pipelines, and easy-to-use analytics tools, the platform allows decision-makers, counselors, and policymakers to gain timely, actionable insights—ultimately enhancing service delivery, improving employment outcomes, and fostering inclusive economic growth. At the core of our work is a commitment to building transparent, responsive, and impactful data systems that serve public interest. Through this collaboration, VDAB is now better equipped to adapt to evolving labor market challenges, personalize support for job seekers, and future-proof its digital foundation for years to come."

          "The VDAB (Flemish Employment and Vocational Training Service) was grappling with a deeply fragmented and outdated data infrastructure that hindered its ability to respond effectively to the evolving demands of the labor market. Its legacy systems, built over decades, operated in silos—making it extremely difficult to collect, consolidate, and process data from various programs, partners, and citizen touchpoints in real time. This lack of integration meant that employment counselors, training providers, and policy makers were forced to make critical decisions based on delayed, inconsistent, or incomplete data. As a result, matching job seekers with appropriate opportunities became inefficient and error-prone, while measuring the effectiveness of training programs or forecasting job market trends lacked the necessary precision. The situation became especially critical during the COVID-19 pandemic. The labor market was shifting rapidly, and without a modern, responsive data platform, VDAB faced delays in deploying targeted interventions, allocating resources efficiently, or tailoring services based on real-time need. Manual data handling and fragmented reporting mechanisms further exacerbated operational inefficiencies, limiting VDAB's agility in crisis response and long-term planning. Beyond operational challenges, this outdated system also affected the citizen experience."

From SIM cloning and international revenue share fraud (IRSF) to subscription and roaming fraud, attackers are constantly evolving their tactics to exploit system vulnerabilities. Traditional rule-based fraud systems are no longer sufficient—they struggle to keep up with the sheer volume of data, real-time requirements, and the sophistication of new attack vectors. Additionally, siloed data systems and lack of advanced analytics make it difficult for fraud investigation teams to detect complex patterns early. By the time fraud is discovered, significant financial damage and customer trust erosion may already have occurred.
